## Exact alarms declaration

- Feature: medication reminders at user-scheduled times
- User benefit: reliable alerts for time-sensitive medications
- Runtime permission requested when enabling reminders / on first launch (consider moving to contextual prompt in a future release)

## Caregiving apps

- App provides caregiving features and is informational only
- In-app AI disclaimer localized via `aiSummaryDisclaimer` string
- Store listing should not claim regulated-device status

## Account deletion

- Path: **Profile → Delete Account** or **Privacy Settings → Delete my account**
- Confirmation requires checkbox: “I understand this is permanent and cannot be reversed”
- Backend: `DELETE /api/users/me` permanently removes Cloud SQL rows, GCS media, Firestore user data, and Firebase Auth
- Individual summaries / scanned documents can be deleted from Overview without deleting the account
- Export / partial record deletion: email `privacy@remiminder.ai` (mailto from Privacy Settings)
- Deletion support contact: `team@remiminderai.com`

## Payments

- Current Android build: upgrade flow opens external pricing page; no in-app digital goods purchase in the shipped router
- If enabling in-app subscriptions later, comply with [Payments policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738)
